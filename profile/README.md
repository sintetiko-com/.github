# Sintetiko

## Overview

Sintetiko is a suite of Bitcoin-backed stablecoins designed to combat the loss of purchasing power associated with fiat currencies. By purchasing Sintetiko stablecoins, users contribute to a treasury that operates to offset the devaluation of fiat money. The management of this treasury is governed by a decentralized governance token, allowing holders to decide how the treasury's profits are distributed.

## Problem Addressed

In an era of fluctuating fiat currencies, maintaining the value of assets can be challenging. Sintetiko addresses this issue by providing stablecoins that are inherently backed by Bitcoin, which has proven its resilience and value retention over time.

## How It Works

1. **Treasury Mechanism**: Funds collected from the sale of Sintetiko stablecoins are directed to a treasury. This treasury is responsible for compensating for fiat currency depreciation.

2. **Governance Token**: The treasury's operations are governed by a token that allows holders to vote on profit distribution strategies.

3. **Oracle-Based Pricing**: The fiat prices are monitored by an algorithm that receives quotes via oracles. This system calculates compensations for governance token holders to address currency fluctuations.

4. **Smart Contract Distribution**: Rewards are distributed based on community voting through a Bitcoin multi-signature smart contract.

5. **Taproot Asset Protocol**: Sintetiko stablecoins are based on the [Taproot Assets Protocol](https://github.com/Roasbeef/bips/blob/bip-tap/bip-tap.mediawiki), which enhances security and efficiency, running on both the Bitcoin main network and the Lightning Network for faster transactions.

## When It Takes Effect

The compensation mechanism activates as market conditions change, ensuring that holders of Sintetiko stablecoins are protected against fiat devaluation.

## About Bitcoin

Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has been a revolutionary force in the financial landscape. Its value has skyrocketed, revaluing significantly and proving to be a hedge against inflation. In recent years, Bitcoin has gained traction as a digital asset, with institutional adoption further solidifying its importance.

## Conclusion

Sintetiko aims to provide a robust solution to the challenges posed by fiat currency devaluation, leveraging Bitcoin's strength and the innovative Taproot Asset protocol for enhanced security and efficiency.
